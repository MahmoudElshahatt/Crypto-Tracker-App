# Crypto Tracker App

Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve just finished The Best Practice Guide to Android Architecture by Philipp Lackner, and itâ€™s been an incredibly rewarding experience!

## Hereâ€™s what I learned:

â€¢ The best practices for implementing clean architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability in my Android projects.

â€¢ Mastering the MVI (Model-View-Intent) pattern for a clear, predictable way to manage app state.

â€¢ How to use Ktor for networking and handle API calls with error handling best practices.

â€¢ Implementing Koin for dependency injection, making the app modular and easily testable.

â€¢ Exploring adaptive navigation, which significantly improved the appâ€™s flexibility and user experience.

â€¢ Tackling the LineChart implementation was a deep dive into math and calculations. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed learning how to use Canvas in Jetpack Compose to draw custom components. It was a challenging but fun experience! ðŸ˜„

The Crypto Tracker App I built may seem simple, but it integrates various approaches and modern technologies. From clean architecture to advanced UI components, I learned a ton from this project.
